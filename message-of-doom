 *** IMPORTANT *** 

This is a development version of bonobo.  You should be using a stable
version, which is available at ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/stable/sources/bonobo/
The version you just configured is meant for developers of bonobo only:

  * You should not base ANY software on this version of bonobo.

  * This software _will_ be breaking binary and source compatibility frequently

  * Furthermore it will not compile for long periods of the week, and this is a
  feature.

  * Also, you might want to look behind you for the axe wielding fiend about to
  batter your brain out if you complain about this. 

Distributions should *NOT* ship a development package of bonobo, 

			....
     Do not bother the mailing lists, IRC channels, or other forums if you cannot
     figure out how to build bonobo. It is not in working condition.
