    This is a list of outstanding items that need to be done to bring
Bonobo to a state of perfection.  Feel free to add to this list.  I've
made an effort to assign these tasks to the people who would be best
suited to do them, but feel free to jump on something if it's not
getting done.

======================

* Compound document printing

* Compound document storage
    . Libefs
    . XML-based


Things to finish
================

Bugs to fix
===========

General Cleanup
===============

Controls etc
------------
* Add Prop CList to Control sample container.
* free values when pb is destroyed.  ReleaserFn
* Fix g_slist_frees in gnome-ui-handler.c -- added FIXMEs.  Don't
  understand the problem currently.
* Fix gpdf
* doc new control/control frame functions
* From gnome-client-site.c: 	CORBA_free (list);	/* FIXME: This does not make any sense at all to me */
* system exception should be on gnome object client. sigh.
* Doc GnomeBonoboWidget functions
* out-of-place views are fucked -- show_window does not make sense in client_site.
* out-of-place -- add embeddable routine, one per
* Toolbar controls -- test

Bonobo-endemic issues
---------------------
* Check for proper unref/destruction handling/mem leaks.
* Compile with zero warnings.
* Base64 encoding for storages streams (provide an XML-based storage)
* Hunt down and kill all FIXMEs.
* _full methods for creating perl/python/scheme bindings
* Simple File IO that takes care of all the repetitive code we add everywhre

Bonobo Core (files in bonobo/)
------------------------------
* Missing embeddable methods implemented.
* Document signals and undo setup.
* Implement printing. (Miguel)
* Fix CORBA robustness issues (SIGSEGV on unfinished corba method invocation)
* UIHandler toolbar code finished (Nat)
* UIHandler documented (Nat)
* Move all test code out of bonobo/bonobo.
* Make sure HACKING is up-to-date.

Issues
------

* Sample applications should provide stream/store facilities
  entirely.  we cant just ship with "will do later" stuff

Interfaces (files in idl/)
--------------------------
* Documented.
* Clean, API-doc'd IDL files.

Components
----------
* Updated to use the new semantics.
* Fully documented.
* Clean up text/plain (Nat)
* Update to do size negotiation.

Sample code (the code in samples/)
----------------------------------
* Write moniker sample code.
* Write up description of paint component. (Nat)
* Reference component in samples/, using gtk-object method (Nat).
