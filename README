This is the distribution of Bonobo, the GNOME component and compound
document system for the GNU system.

* What is Bonobo

   Bonobo is a set of language and system independante CORBA
interfaces for creating reusable components and creating compound
documents.

   The Bonobo distribution includes a Gtk+ based implementation of the
Bonobo interfaces, enabling developers to create reusable components
and applications that can be used to form more complex documents.

* What you will need

   You will need a working GNOME 1.0 system with the development tools
to compile and install Bonobo.

* The layout 

   You will find documentation for Bonobo in the "doc" directory.  The
actual implementation of bonobo is in the "bonobo" directory.  The
CORBA interfaces are in the "idl" directory.
