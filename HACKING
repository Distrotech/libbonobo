How to Hack Bonobo
------------------

    Bonobo will serve as the foundation for component-based
application development in GNOME.  Modern GNOME applications will
therefore be built out of Bonobo components.  One of the goals of the
component model is to allow developers to produce robust and
maintainable applications.  So it is of central importance that the
code for the Bonobo component model be clean and well-documented.
Component developers will base their code on the infrastructure Bonobo
hackers are creating, and so it is critical that Bonobo set a
precedent for high-quality software.

    Please following the following guidelines when you contribute code
to Bonobo:

	. Follow the GNOME Programming Guidelines.

		All of the Bonobo source code must follow the GNOME
		Programming Guidelines in terms of formatting style
		and programming technique.  In particular, Bonobo code
		should be indented with 8-space tabs.  Emacs users can
		execute the following elisp to use this indentation
		style:

			(set-c-style "K&R")
			(setq c-basic-offset 8)

		Indentation is just one part of the GNOME Programming
		Guidelines, so please read them.  The programming
		guidelines can be found in the white-papers CVS
		module.

	. All Bonobo interface methods and API routines must be
	  documented.
