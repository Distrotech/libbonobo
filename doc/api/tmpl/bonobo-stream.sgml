Abstract object for file (stream) access.

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
   This is an abstract class for the various Stream implementations in
   Bonobo.  There are at least: file based streams, memory based
   streams and structured storage streams.   The BonoboStream abstract
   class can be used to implement new servers that implement the
   IDL:Bonobo/Stream:1.0 interface.

<para>
   If you are writing a component, this is one interface that your
component should not really support. You probably want to implement
the a #BonoboPersist interface such as #BonoboPersistStream. This
allows a component to serialize itself and de-persist itself using
a stream supplied by a container.
</para>

<para>
   If you are implementing a stream you probably want to see some
of the helpful wrappers first.
