Hi,

Here is what I understand from the discussion:

1.  gnome-session starts
2.  a new activationcontext (and objectdirectory) is created
3.  an app requests the activation of an IDL, at some host
4.  the activationcontext looks for the objectdirectory for the
        host and X/no-X connection type
5.  if it is found, goto #7
6.  start up the objectdirectory (rsh, ssh, ?)
7.  ask the objectdirectory for a reference to the object
8.  return this to the application which requested

Is this pretty much the idea you had, or am I still missing something?

Thanks,
Jacob
