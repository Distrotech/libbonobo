OAF will search a number of directories for .oafinfo files.
It will use the GNOME_PATH, OAF_INFO_PATH, OAFINFODIR env
variables and the ${prefix}/etc/oaf/oaf-config.xml file.

OAFINFODIR is deprecated.
OAF_INFO_PATH should be used like this: 
export OAF_INFO_PATH=/opt/gnome/share/oaf:/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf:/usr/local/gnome/share/oaf:/usr/local/share/oaf
GNOME_PATH should be the standard GNOME env var used by GNOME to determine
where the many GNOME packages are installed. Each entry in GNOME_PATH should 
point to the install prefix of a GNOME package.
export GNOME_PATH=/opt/gnome:/usr/local/gnome:/opt/gnome/oaf:/opt/gnome/gnome-vfs:/opt/gnome/bonobo


Last, the oaf-config.xml file is used by oaf. oaf will search each 
of the directory specified there for .oafinfo files. A sample oaf-config.xml
file is include in the oaf tarball. Its syntax is pretty simple. You just need
to add new items in the searchpath tag. Ths fil will be read everytime oaf is
restarted.

<?xml version="1.0"?>

<oafconfig>

<searchpath>
<item>/opt/gnome/share/oaf</item>
<item>/usr/local/gnome/share/oaf</item>
<item>/usr/local/share/oaf</item>
<item>/opt/gnome/oaf/share/oaf</item>
</searchpath>

</oafconfig>
