Oaf debugging advice, version 0.1


Since it is not transparently obvious how to debug oaf the following
suggestions may be of use.


* Attach the debugger.

	It is not possible to run oaf in the debugger, instead you
must activate oaf by doing a valid query; then attach the debugger
to the process;

	This might be done like this;

	make install       # this installs oaf where it can be run
	killall -9 oafd    # asasinate any stale oafd

	oaf-run-query "repo_ids.has('foo')" # fire up a lurking oafd.

	ps -ax | grep oafd # get the <pid> of oafd
	libtool gdb ./oafd # start gdb on oafd
	attach <pid>	   # attach to the pid of the oaf daemon.


* OAF_BARRIER_INIT

	Set this environment variable to 1, and set a breakpoint
in <FIXME>
