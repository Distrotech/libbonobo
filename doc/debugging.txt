Since it is not transparently obvious how to debug Bonobo components
the following suggestions may be of use.

Firstly, it is vital to ensure that the correct versions of both the
component and the container are being run. The safest way to make sure
this is the case is to explicitly run them. eg.

	./bonobo-my-component & ./my-test-container

Secondly it is rather important to make sure that bonobo has compiled
and installed correctly. If you are using CVS ensure that your bonobo
has installed without errors and that you have run ldconfig.

So: debugging. The best way to do this is to have two X-terms, in one
run the component:

	gdb ./bonobo-my-component
	$ r

And in the second run the container:

	gdb ./my-test-container
	$ r

NB. It is of course important to ensure that the component has registered
before executing the container. A good guide is to wait until your hard
disk has stopped thrashing madly before running the container.

If all else fails try removing the gnome-name-service,
cleaning any installed binaries and removing
etc/CORBA/servers/bonobo-my-component.gnorba and trying again.

NB. If you are doing serious development consider compiling gtk+, glib
and bonobo with debugging symbols:

	export CFLAGS='-g' ; ./configure

And finally when the handfuls of hair are coming out thick and fast,
consider reading the source, it only looks scary, it won't bite.
